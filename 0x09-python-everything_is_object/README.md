# Everything is an Object in Python

This project aims to explore and illustrate the fundamental concept in Python that everything, from numbers to functions, is an object.

## Overview

In Python, every piece of data is an instance of an object. This project provides examples and explanations to help understanding how this object-oriented paradigm is fundamental to Python programming.
