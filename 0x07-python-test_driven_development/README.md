# Python - Test-driven development

## Overview

This project is dedicated to practicing and demonstrating the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. Embracing TDD promotes writing tests before the actual code, ensuring robust and reliable software development.

## Features

- **Test-Driven Development Practice**: Learn and apply the TDD methodology to create robust and well-tested Python code.
- **Unit Testing**: Explore the creation of unit tests using the `unittest` framework or other testing frameworks of your choice.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate the project with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing processes on each code commit.
- **Code Coverage**: Strive for high code coverage by writing tests that thoroughly exercise your code.
- **Documentation**: Keep your project well-documented, including information on running tests and contributing to the project.
