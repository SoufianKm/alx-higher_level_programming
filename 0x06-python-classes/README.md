# Python - Classes and Objects

## Overview

Welcome to the `Python - Classes and Objects` project! This repository serves as a learning resource to help Python developers understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP), with a specific focus on classes and objects. Whether you are a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced developer aiming to reinforce your understanding, this project provides clear examples and explanations.

## Features

- **Introduction to Classes**: Learn the concept of classes and how they are used to model real-world entities in Python.
- **Object Instances**: Understand the instantiation of objects from classes and explore the attributes and methods associated with instances.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Explore the principles of encapsulation and abstraction in OOP and how they are implemented in Python.
- **Inheritance**: Delve into the concept of inheritance, allowing you to create a new class based on an existing class, fostering code reuse and extensibility.
