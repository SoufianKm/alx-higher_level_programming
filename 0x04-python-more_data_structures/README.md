# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

Welcome to the Python Learning directory dedicated to exploring advanced data structures in Python - Sets and Dictionaries! üêç

## Overview

This directory is designed to deepen your understanding of essential Python data structures, specifically Sets and Dictionaries. Mastering these structures is key to efficiently managing and manipulating data in various Python applications.

**Sets:** Delve into the world of Sets, an unordered collection of unique elements. Understand how Sets can be employed for tasks like membership testing, removing duplicates, and set operations.

**Dictionaries:** Explore the versatility of Dictionaries, Python's key-value store. Learn how to efficiently store and retrieve data using keys, and discover the power of dictionary comprehensions and built-in methods.

## Key Features
