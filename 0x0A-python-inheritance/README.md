# Python - Inheritance

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing inheritance concepts in Python. Inheritance is a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows the creation of a new class by extending the features of an existing class. This project provides practical examples and exercises to deepen your understanding of inheritance in Python.

## Features

- **Inheritance Basics**: Learn the fundamental principles of inheritance in Python.
- **Superclasses and Subclasses**: Understand the concepts of superclasses and subclasses and how they enable code reuse.
- **Method Overriding**: Explore method overriding, a powerful technique to customize behavior in derived classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Delve into polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
- **Real-world Examples**: Apply inheritance to real-world scenarios through hands-on coding exercises.
