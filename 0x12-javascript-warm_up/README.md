- `scripts.js`: JavaScript file containing exercise code.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project.

## Exercises

The `scripts.js` file contains a series of exercises to complete. Each exercise is commented with instructions and tasks to perform. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of JavaScript basics.
